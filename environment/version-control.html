<h1>Version Control</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
    Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
    Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
    If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix
    the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. It is important to state that version control is not
    just used to version code. It should be used on any project file that can be versioned,
    which includes text files, model files, image files etc.

    It is important to note that software teams that do not use any form of version control often run into problems like
    not knowing which changes that have been made are available to users or the creation of incompatible changes between
    two unrelated pieces of work that must then be painstakingly untangled and reworked.

    Version control software is an essential part of the every-day of the modern software team's professional practices.
    Individual software developers who are accustomed to working with a capable version control system in their teams
    typically recognize the incredible value version control also gives them even on small solo projects. Once
    accustomed to the powerful benefits of version control systems, many developers wouldn't consider working without it
    even for non-software projects.

    Version Control Systems (VCS) have seen great improvements over the past few decades and some are better than
    others. VCS are sometimes known as SCM (Source Code Management) tools or RCS (Revision Control System). One of the
    most popular VCS tools in use today is called Git. Git is a Distributed VCS, a category known as DVCS.
