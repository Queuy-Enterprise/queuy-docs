<h1>Version Control</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
    Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
    Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
    If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix
    the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. It is important to state that version control is not
    just used to version code. It should be used on any project file that can be versioned,
    which includes text files, model files, image files etc.

    </p>
</div>
<p>
    It is important to note that software teams that do not use any form of version control often run into problems like
    not knowing which changes that have been made are available to users or the creation of incompatible changes between
    two unrelated pieces of work that must then be painstakingly untangled and reworked.
</p>
<p>
    Version control software is an essential part of the every-day of the modern software team's professional practices.
    Individual software developers who are accustomed to working with a capable version control system in their teams
    typically recognize the incredible value version control also gives them even on small solo projects. Once
    accustomed to the powerful benefits of version control systems, many developers wouldn't consider working without it
    even for non-software projects.
</p>
<p>
    Version Control Systems (VCS) have seen great improvements over the past few decades and some are better than
    others. VCS are sometimes known as SCM (Source Code Management) tools or RCS (Revision Control System). One of the
    most popular VCS tools in use today is called Git. Git is a Distributed VCS, a category known as DVCS.
</p>
<h2>What is Git</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively
    maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux
    operating system kernel.
</p>
<p>
    Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). Rather
    than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version
    control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is
    also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

<p>
    Git is the most broadly adopted tool of its kind. Vast numbers of developers already have Git experience and a
    significant proportion of college graduates may have experience with only Git. While some organizations may need to
    climb the learning curve when migrating to Git from another version control system, many of their existing and
    future developers do not need to be trained on Git.
</p>
<h2>Getting started with Git</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Git is a very powerful tool and as noted before is essential to any mature development workflow. However, due to
    it's complexity learning it from the ground up can prove to be a challenge even to experienced software developers.
    In this section we are going to quickly go through the process of installation and learning basic commands
    you need to know to get started with Git.
</p>
<h3>Install Git</h3>
<p>
    Here is how to install Git on Ubuntu distributions:
</p>
{% highlight sh %}
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install git
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    Now verify that the installation was successful:
</p>
{% highlight sh %}
    $ git --version
    git version 2.30.2
{% endhighlight %}
<h3>Initialize repository</h3>
<p>
    To be able to place your code under version control you need a Git repository. You can easily initialize a Git
    repository with a simple one-time command that will create a new <code>.git</code> subdirectory in your current
    working directory and also create a new main branch.
</p>
<p>
    Let's create your first Git repository. Navigate to the directory that you want to make the root directory
    of your repository. For example, let's create a repository in <code>~/Documents/GitHub/project/</code>
    directory:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    $ mkdir -p ~/Documents/Github/project/
    $ cd ~/Documents/Github/project/
    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in ~/Documents/GitHub/project/.git
{% endhighlight %}
<div class="note-box">
    <div class="note-title">Note</div>
    <p>The initial repository will be completely empty without any commits. This is in contrast to creating new
        repositories with Github that will automatically have a single commit called "Initial commit".</p>
</div>
<h3>Clone repository</h3>
<p>
    If a project has already been set up in a GitHub repository, the clone command is the most common way for users to
    obtain a local development clone. The repository can also be cloned by obtaining the link to repository and
    using GitHub Desktop to clone the repository with a graphical interface.
</p>
<p>
    Let's clone the repository of the pages you are currently reading:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    $ git clone https://github.com/Queuy-Enterprise/queuy-docs.git
    Cloning into 'queuy-docs'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 230, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (230/230), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (132/132), done.
    remote: Total 230 (delta 83), reused 214 (delta 73), pack-reused 0
    Receiving objects: 100% (230/230), 98.31 KiB | 1.89 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (83/83), done.
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    There are many different parameters you can use when cloning your repository. For example you can clone the
    repository to a specific directory, clone a specific tag or branch, specify depth of history you want to clone,
    and much more.
</p>
<div class="note-box">
    <div class="note-title">Note</div>
    <p>
        For more information on using the <code>git clone</code> command you can read the
        <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone">Atlassian tutorial</a>
        or the official <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">Git documentation</a>.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>The Git index</h3>
<p>
    The Git index is used as a staging area between your working directory and your repository. You can use the index to
    build up a set of changes that you want to commit together. When you create a commit, what is committed is what is
    currently in the index, not what is in your working directory.
</p>
<p>
    Before we commit our change we need to add them to the index with the following command:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    $ mkdir -p ~/Documents/Github/project/
    $ cd ~/Documents/Github/project/
    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in ~/Documents/GitHub/project/.git
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    To see what is currently in the index run the following command:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    $ git status
    On branch gh-pages
    Your branch is behind 'origin/gh-pages' by 14 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
    (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

    Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add {{ "<file>" }}..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore {{ "<file>" }}..." to discard changes in working directory)
    {% raw %}
    modified:   assets/css/style.scss
    {% endraw %}
    modified:   environment/version-control.html

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    Here you can see that I have two files that were modified but not yet staged for commit. Before we can commit
    these changes we need to first add them to the index, so let's do that now:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    $ git add .
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    This command uses <code>.</code> character to add <b>all</b> changes in the current directory (recursively)
    to the index. You can also add modified files manually by supplying the <code>git add</code> command
    with a list of files you want to add to index:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    {{ "$ git add <first_file> <second_file>" }}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    Note that you can add as much files as you want to the index in a single command, however it is often more
    convenient to just use the <code>.</code> character to add everything to the index rather then specifying each
    file one by one. If you have added a file to index by accident or have decided that you do not want to commit a
    specific file you can remove it from the index with the following command:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    {{ "$ git restore --staged <file>" }}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    As with adding files to index, if you want to remove all changes from your index you can use the
    <code>.</code> character:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    {{ "$ git restore --staged ." }}
{% endhighlight %}
<h3>Git diff</h3>
<p>
    Git diff shows changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes resulting from a merge, changes
    between two branches or two commits. In essence it takes two input data sets and outputs the changes between them.
</p>
<div class="note-box">
    <div class="note-title">Note</div>
    <p>
        You can use <code>git diff</code> to see changes between files that are not under version control by
        including the <code>--no-index</code> parameter before non optional arguments.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Let's try add and commit two files with different content and compare them with <code>git diff</code> command.
    First we will create and commit one file, modify it and see the diff between working tree and index:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    $ echo 'I like pancakes' > file1
    $ git add file1 && git commit -m "Start liking pancakes"
    $ echo 'I love waffles' >> file1
    $ git diff file1
    diff --git a/file1 b/file1
    index c0b5e9e..114ef85 100644
    --- a/file1
    +++ b/file1
    @@ -1 +1,2 @@
    I like pancakes
    +I love waffles
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    In the output above we can clearly see that a single line of text was added to the end of <code>file1</code>.
    Now let's create the second file and compare it's content with that of the first file we created:
</p>
{% highlight none %}
    $ echo 'I do not like pineapple' > file2
    $ echo 'I do not like kiwi' >> file2
    $ git add file2 && git commit -m "List what I don't like"
    $ git diff HEAD:file1 -- file2
    diff --git a/file1 b/file2
    index c0b5e9e..36c5a72 100644
    --- a/file1
    +++ b/file2
    @@ -1 +1,2 @@
    -I like pancakes
    +I do not like pineapple
    +I do not like kiwi
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    We just went through two examples but you should already see that <code>git diff</code> is a simple command that
    is very useful in your day to day workflow. Normally we would use the graphical interface provided by GitHub Desktop
    to see the diff between the working tree and the index, however if we need to compare branches or specific commits
    we need to use the <code>git diff</code> command to get clear results.
</p>
<div class="note-box">
<div class="note-title">Note</div>
<p>
    Remember that you can direct the output of <code>git diff</code> command to a text file so it's easier to read.
    If you are using a text editor that supports diff syntax highlighting you can export the output to a
    <code>.diff</code> file and make the diff even easier to read.
