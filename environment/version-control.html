<h1>Version Control</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
    Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
    Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
    If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix
    the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. It is important to state that version control is not
    just used to version code. It should be used on any project file that can be versioned,
    which includes text files, model files, image files etc.
