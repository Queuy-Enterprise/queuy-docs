Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Yeah okay. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?
My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Is she pretty? What's with the life preserver? Good morning. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-
George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Yoo. Doc, wait. No, bastards. What? Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.
Hello, Jennifer. Okay Doc, this is it. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...
Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Don't tell me anything. You okay, is everything alright? Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Take care. Well, they're bigger than me. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.
You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Hello. I have to tell you about the future. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.
Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Wait a minute. What? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.
Lorraine. Lorraine, are you up there? Well yeah, you know we have two of them. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. George: you ever think of running for class president?
What's with the life preserver? Science Fiction Theater. What's with the life preserver? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life

No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Don't say a word. Yeah. Oh. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.
Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Oh. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Ahh.
Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Well, I figured, what the hell. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? No. Who, who?
Yeah okay. What? Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.
Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Let's go. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.
